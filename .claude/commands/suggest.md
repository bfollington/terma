Review the content of `lib` and consider if the commands we're exporting from the root are the best possible set.

Let's imagine how to make generalizable building blocks that are useful across all projects, covering the painful parts of development with great care and insight.

We are aiming to create atomic modules of design, programming, engineering and debugging wisdom derived from years of hard work and practice. We will then compose those into useful 'commands' or 'macros' that can be used to massively improve the outcome of using LLMs for coding and development.

Suggest improvements and commands to add or retire.
