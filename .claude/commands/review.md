We are aiming to create atomic modules of design, programming, engineering and debugging wisdom derived from years of hard work and practice. We will then compose those into useful 'commands' or 'macros' that can be used to massively improve the outcome of using LLMs for coding and development.

Review the contents of lib from a critical POV and suggestion refinements, edits, examples or contrasting viewports to bolster the quality of the modules.
