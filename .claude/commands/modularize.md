Review the content of `lib` and examine any large files for potential modularization opportunities. Consider breaking down complex modules into more focused chunks. This will help us reduce duplication and group related material across the library.

We are aiming to create atomic modules of design, programming, engineering and debugging wisdom derived from years of hard work and practice. We will then compose those into useful 'commands' or 'macros' that can be used to massively improve the outcome of using LLMs for coding and development.

We must be careful to maintain the include graph's validity, you can rebuild the notes using `build.sh` and see if it succeeds.
