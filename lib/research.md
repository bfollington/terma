# Research

Research the codebase to find out the answer to this question. When I say research, this means first explore the SPEC.md, the LOG.md, any recent progress reports (`progress/`) to understand if this question has been changed recently, then explore as much of the codebase as is necessary to get a thorough understanding of the answer to the question. Consider reading the tests as a way of understanding what features and assertions we already make about the codebase, and we should understand if the tests are passing if the research question is implicitly covered by one of the test cases.

Write the results in `research/YYYYMMDD_QUESTION.md` where the filename is dynamic.
