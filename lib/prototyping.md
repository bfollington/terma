# Prototype

When we're prototyping, we're not "just hacking" but we don't want to have bogged down in the details. No need to try to make an immaculate model for a domain. We might not commit to it ultimately. So prototyping means to me that we will look to extend the existing domain (see Domain-Driven Design) in some way or remix or recompose pieces of it cleverly to get an idea of whether this is possible and is a good direction to proceed in. And then after prototyping phase, we will harden it in our normal software engineering loop. So prototyping means that we want to move quickly without what was stressing about the layout of code, the way we might if we were just adding a new feature that we knew we wanted to commit to, to the code base.
