Let's follow a test driven approach for this feature where we'll ride the tests ahead of time and make them fail and then continually run them until they pass to verify that we've done what we wanted to do. This way we can step by step build up the complex layers of this kind of domain without getting too many risks of misunderstanding or a nightmare for debugging it on the other side.

Make sure to look at all the existing tests and check whether your property plays to insert new tests is, whether test should be updated or changed in the course of development is a difficult decision and may require insulting the spec or the change log of any recent things that we've done to understand the context of why the tests are behaving the way that they are.

Consult the SPEC.md to understand the requirements and constraints of the application.
