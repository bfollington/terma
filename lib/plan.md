We're going to plan the next steps carefully. No implementation, just consider the path ahead deeply. We're always optimizing the best use of our time and tokens, not trying to speed run the exercise.

# Plan

Based on our research, let's plan the approach. Each step is exactly one and only one change, where we can evaluate success in between. Stay focused on the fundamentals, let's lay the foundation, then the scaffolding and only then consider the cladding.

Once we understand the steps, we can divide the work into parallelizable work units (if any exist) and plan how to use subagents to implement and verify each step. We need to plan the sync points carefully and how to avoid the agents stepping on one another's changes.
