# Railway Oriented Programming: Wlaschin's Error Handling Philosophy

## Core Principle: Two-Track Model

Think of functions as railway tracks with two rails:
- **Success track** - Happy path where everything works
- **Failure track** - Error path with accumulated error information

Functions become switches that can move execution between tracks based on success or failure.

## The Railway Type

### Definition
A specialized Either type focused on error handling:
```
type Result<'TSuccess, 'TError> =
    | Success of 'TSuccess * 'TError list
    | Failure of 'TError list
```

Both tracks can carry error information for comprehensive error reporting.

## Track Operations

### Essential Functions

1. **Bind (>>=)** - Connect monadic functions
   - Takes a two-track input
   - Applies function only on success track
   - Preserves failure track unchanged

2. **Map** - Adapt one-track functions
   - Lifts normal functions to work on success track
   - Automatically bypasses on failure

3. **Tee** - Side effects without derailing
   - For logging, metrics, notifications
   - Executes on success but returns original input
   - Essential since F# doesn't use IO monad

4. **Compose (>=>)** - Kleisli composition
   - Combines railway functions sequentially
   - Creates larger functions from smaller ones

## Error Handling Patterns

### Exception Adaptation
Convert exceptions to railway failures:
- Wrap dangerous operations
- Map exceptions to domain-specific error types
- Keep error handling explicit and type-safe

### Parallel Validation (&&&)
Combine multiple validations:
- Run all validations regardless of individual failures
- Accumulate all errors for comprehensive feedback
- Return success only if all succeed

### Dead-End Functions
Handle functions that return unit:
- Use tee for side effects
- Convert to two-track with success continuation
- Maintain railway flow

## Design Principles

### Custom Error Types
- Domain-specific error cases, not strings
- Compiler-enforced exhaustive handling
- Self-documenting failure modes
- Support for internationalization

### Consistent Style
- One way to write error-handling code
- Predictable patterns for maintenance
- Explicit error paths in type signatures
- No hidden exceptions

### Composition Over Complexity
- Small, focused functions
- Build complex flows from simple switches
- Errors bubble up naturally
- Easy to add new error handling

## Implementation Strategy

### Function Categories

1. **Adapters** - Convert between track types
   - `switch`: one-track to two-track
   - `map`: normal function to railway function
   - `tee`: side-effect to railway function

2. **Combinators** - Compose railway functions
   - `bind`: sequential composition
   - `>=>`: Kleisli composition
   - `&&&`: parallel composition

3. **Converters** - Bridge external world
   - Exception handlers
   - Validation functions
   - API response mappers

## Key Benefits

1. **Explicit Error Paths** - No hidden failures
2. **Composable** - Build complex flows from simple parts
3. **Type-Safe** - Compiler ensures error handling
4. **Comprehensive** - Accumulate all relevant errors
5. **Maintainable** - Consistent, predictable patterns

## Extensions

The railway pattern supports:
- Logging infrastructure
- Domain events
- Compensating transactions
- Circuit breakers
- Retry logic
- Performance monitoring

## Warning: Don't Overuse

Railway-oriented programming is powerful but not universal:
- Simple scenarios may not need two tracks
- Performance-critical code might need optimization
- Some domains have better-suited patterns
- Balance explicitness with simplicity

## Recipe, Not Just Theory

This approach provides:
- Concrete implementation patterns
- Consistent coding style
- Practical error handling
- Real-world applicability
- Team-wide conventions

The goal: versatile enough for most situations, constrained enough to enforce consistency.
