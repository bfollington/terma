# Feature

When adding or changing a feature of the application consult (or create) the SPEC.md file and see if there are any features similar to this one, or if this feature already exists, or if this feature would contradict or clash with any features mentioned in the SPEC.md file. We'll need to update the spec with the description of the new feature first. If there are lots of tests for existing kinds of features, we should consider creating new tests or changing the tests to include new feature and then implementing the feature against those tests.

SPEC.md should be sufficient for somebody to have an understanding of how they expect the application to operate, but does not have to be a comprehensive documentation of every minute feature. It is more of a user story level description of the application. It will mention the core ubiquitous language terms, but probably will not have very much code actually embedded within it.
