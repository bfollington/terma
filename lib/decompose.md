# Decompose

Let's break this large module/monolith apart into smaller modular chunks. This might be a fractal process that takes several iterations to get right. So let's focus on first working out the right divisions of the code and breaking it apart without refactoring anything along the way. We want to just break it into logical units along whatever lines already exist and then whatever tension appears, we can then start to refactor and think more granularly from there. But any division of large files of a mixed function into somewhat useful groupings, just to preserve context windows of humans and albums alike is always useful.
