# Change Phases

If we have a previous feature, let's update `LOG.md` to explain our changes and if they were substantial, let's ask the user if they want a progress report. We should clear the context window before beginning work on the new session, so we have to update `CLAUDE.md`, `SPEC.md,`, `LOG.md` and any progress reports to document everything.

Then, let's use planning mode to chart a course to the next checkpoint.
