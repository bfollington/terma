# Research

Research the codebase to find out the answer to this question. Explore as much of the codebase as is necessary to get a thorough understanding. Consider reading the tests as a way of understanding what features and assertions we already make about the codebase, and whether the research question is implicitly covered by existing test cases.

Write the results in `research/YYYYMMDD_QUESTION.md` where the filename is dynamic.
