# Writing good code

- prefer functions over classes unless managing resources
- let the types and signatures do the talking
- prefer flat code, small focused routines
- the program should read like the story of what it does
- the structure and name of the modules is critical
- write the types first, then the functions, then the tests, then the integrations
- make the smallest change possible or leave the code cleaner than you found it
- rigor and intentionality upfront is worth it

write code like Rich Hickey
