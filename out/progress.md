# Progress Report

!(./subagent.md)

The subagent will capture our progress from this session in a report. Include the initial thrust of this conversation, the features that we've implemented and tackled, any challenges faced and what changes we ultimately landed on and any learnings in the process, maybe any intent for future, and refactorings or improvement to the code, basically so that we can put the session down and the next person who comes along to pick this up will understand what we were thinking and where I had was at, and hopefully be able to get back into the swing of things as quickly as possible.

Progress reports live in `progress/YYYMMDD_FEAT_report.md` (filename is dynamic) with a highlevel summary in `LOG.md` of the changes, linking to the detailed report. Think planfiles, not business waffle.

Update `HUD.md` with session completion status and next priorities.
