Let's reflect: $ARGUMENTS

How did we get here? Did I write something, or did you read something that was confusing or misleading? Did you try to avoid embarassing me, or yourself along the way? There's no blame here, if you made a mistake it's because the instructions were poor.

How would you, with hindsight, alter the instructions or approach we took here in the future? What steps can we take immediately?
